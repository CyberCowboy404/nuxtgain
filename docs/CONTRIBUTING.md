## Getting Started

NuxtGain is an open-source project, and we welcome contributions of all kinds: from bug reports to feature requests, documentation improvements to code contributions.

### Reporting Bugs

If you've found a bug, please open an issue on our GitHub repository. When filing a bug report, please include:

- A clear title and description
- As much relevant information as possible
- A code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to existing functionality, please open an issue on our GitHub repository. Describe the feature you'd like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

### Code Contributions

If you'd like to contribute code to fix a bug or implement a new feature:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch for your feature or fix
3. Write your code
4. Commit your changes
5. Push your branch and open a pull request

Please keep your changes focused on a single issue or feature. If you find another bug or want to implement another feature, please open a separate pull request.

## Code Style

We follow the Vue.js style guide and use ESLint for linting. Please ensure your code adheres to these standards.
